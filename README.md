# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office
This project is a part of the DataCamp "Data Scientist Professional with Python" course series.

In this project, I applied the skills I learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. The purpose of this project was to discover if Netflixâ€™s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using lists,  loops, pandas, and matplotlib.

I performed critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots I created of the data.
